# Building-Database-PostgreSQL
In this repository you will find the code for creating a PostgreSQL database and modeling and ingesting data through .csv files using Python and Pandas.
Also I want to give a special thanks to [@DarshilParmar](https://www.youtube.com/@DarshilParmar), for helping me in the development of these very important projects on the self-taught path to learning data engineering!

# Content
The content of this repository is as follows:
- The ***"data"*** folder, which contains all the .csv files used
- The file ***"Data Model Exercise Part 1.ipynb"*** is a test or exercise where we experiment with connecting and inserting data to the PostgreSQL database
- The ***"Data Model Building .ipynb"*** file contains all the final code that underpins the project. It contains the entire process of modeling, cleaning and data ingestion.
- The ***"Data Model.dio"*** file is the schema of the data model that we use for our project.

# Requirements
You need to have installed or use the following tools to run the code:
- **Python** (3rd version)
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Jupyter Lab** / **Jupyter Notebooks** / **Google Colab** / **VSCode** (to run .ipynb files)
- Libraries:
  - **psycopg2**
  - **pandas**
